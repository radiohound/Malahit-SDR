- something in the little things

1.0b:

  waterfall field when receiving in WFM. RDS reception is only possible if the
  RDS level is high enough
- fixed bug of filter switching on additional board

1.0d:
- fixed USB operation - USB was unstable on version 1.0c
- protection against false switching is made - when switching on, press the
  button 3 times within an interval of 5 seconds

1.0e:
- a possibly critical error has been fixed - there was an incorrect work with
  memory and there could be problems with data processing;
- added additional characters in the font, when displaying RDS and CW decoder
  information;
- corrected S-meter - now more accurate S scales;
- added the ability to indicate the signal level in dBm - in the HARD menu,
  the "Ind type" parameter. Readings are displayed to the right of the S meter
  scale.

1.0f:
- introduced a stylized retro scale in the FM broadcast range;
- increased the degree of averaging of the S-meter;
- changed the frequency correction mechanism - now it should be more accurate
  and does not depend on the frequency at which the calibration is done;

- renamed the state of the parameters: "Enable" to "Enabled", "Disable" to "Disabled";
- fixed a bug when working with a step of 8.33 kHz;
- fixed error with receiver stuck at low supply voltage;
- added selection of clock frequency depending on the processor revision:
  revision Y operates at 465MHz, revision V - at 480MHz;
- reduced interference from the touchscreen;

  brightness control;
- The error of saving settings in the Visual and Audio menus has been fixed -
  earlier settings might not be saved when they were changed;
- S-meter correction made when UHF is turned on
- made the mode of enabling and disabling the image of the panorama and
  waterfall - in the Visual menu the parameter "View Pan & Wtf. In this mode,
  the data in the display is only clamped when changing the settings by the
  user. This reduces the level of interference.
- fixed a bug with step selection - the bug led to a frequency failure when
  choosing a step;
- added shutdown timer - in the HARD menu the Activity timer button;
- the switching mechanism is changed - one press at a time in three;
- in the Visual menu, the bug with the backlight of the "LCD Sleep" button has
  been fixed.

1.10a:
- changed the inscription on the splash screen;
- changed the inscription of the Vbat control option - Standart is replaced by Standard;
- at the request of the users, the sensitivity of the touchscreen returned -
  please do not complain about the possible interference, we were not
  supporters of this return :)
- changed the setting of the reverse encoders. This is now one option on the hard menu;
- added autosearch of stations for Retroscale in VHF FM;
- added the option step "<-NEXT->" on the Retroscale for transition by rotating the knob
  from station to station (if available on the scale);
- added color selection (one of three) for Retroscale;
- added IQ swap option to the HARD menu - to solve problems with Chinese
  clones, in which I and Q signals are mixed;
- on the main screen the AGC adjustment is replaced by ATT;
- added a DC suppression adjustment function to the VISUAL menu - this is a hump in the 
  center of the panorama.

1.10b:
- fixed error in the S-meter readings for frequencies above 30MHz;
- the panorama scale injection has been changed - now instead of x1, x2, x4,
  160kHz, 80kHz, 40kHz are shown;
- in SSB the 100kHz step is excluded and the 25Hz step is added;
- the touchscreen sensitivity is lowered again :);
- added synchronous AM detector;
- the frequency at which the low-pass filter 500000 is turned on is increased
  to 540,000, for better suppression of signals above the frequency of 500 kHz;
- added Auto Notch filter to the Audio menu;
- stretched grunginess adjustment;
- added DSB mode - as a kind of SSB;
- added CW mode - as a kind of SSB;

1.10c:
- improved graphical display of the spectrum
- improved optimization of algorithms, increased display speed, especially in WFM mode
- added the ability to determine the type of inclusion - one or three clicks.
  If PD15 (pin 7 of the RESERVED field) is open, then turn on by one press; if
  this pin is shorted to a common wire, then turn on by three clicks
- the HARD menu has been improved
- changed battery indication - voltage is indicated over the picture
- added the ability to control user equipment using a discrete signal - PD14
  (pin 8 of the RESERVED field)
- added a button for switching audio output in the HARD menu. It duplicates
  the audio output switch. Made by user request.
- added modes SAM-U and SAM-L

- respectively, added Retroscale for the Japanese VHF FM band 76.1 MHz - 94.9
  MHz and 6 presets for different regions of Japan, agreed with Japanese
  users.
- Fixed a bug when canceling the autosearch mode for stations and when exiting
  the autosearch without saving the found one (refusing to save the found). In
  previous versions, in these cases, all stations that were on the scale
  before the start of the autosearch were erased and the scale became empty.
  Now, in these cases, the original scale is restored.
- the design of the regular end of autosearch has been changed, a table-grid
  of frequencies for found stations has been added, messages about the absence
  or the number of stations found have been added.
- autosearch is no longer dependent on the inclusion of the stereo mode and
  the state of the activated outputs to the speaker and headphones, it works
  in any combination of states, after the end of the search, the original
  state of the stereo mode is restored.
- in some places of the editing menu, the retroscales of the CANCEL key names
  are changed to EXIT, as they are closer in the meaning of the action being
  performed.
- Added a limitation on the number of stations on Retroskale - 69 for the CCIR
  band and 63 for JAPAN - as the maximum number with an interval between
  neighboring stations from 300 kHz and above.
- fixed minor bugs of previous versions related to preserving the color of the
  scales and saving the step type (50 kHz / NEXT) for each scale.
- reduced the speed of switching stations in the NEXT step mode.
- the operation of the synchronous AM detector has been fixed (07/26/2021)

1.10d:
- fixed the error indicating the firmware version. The version is now
  indicated on the splash screen in the lower right corner
- added display noise reduction function to HARD menu 
- WTF replaced with WF
- changed encoder control - now, being in the menu, the frequency encoder is
  used for control

- added the ability to select colors in the Visual menu
- excluded Sleeptime parameter for backlight control
- no delay when switching between menus
- small bugs fixed
